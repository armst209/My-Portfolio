                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp;Aaron Armstrong</strong>
                <br />I am a former educator, technical recruiter and Japanese
                translator turned software developer. As a recruiter, I was very
                curious about the technologies my clients were using, so I
                decided to pursue an after-hours boot camp at Grand Circus.
                <br />
                My background in education and translation has strengthened my
                organizational skills and attention to detail while my time as a
                recruiter has developed my project management skills.
                <br />
                As I have transitioned into the role of software developer,
                these skills, combined with the technical knowledge I gained at
                Grand Circus, have become vital in how I approach coding issues,
                team projects, and learning new technologies. I hope to add my
                experience and skills to your tech team.
                <br />
